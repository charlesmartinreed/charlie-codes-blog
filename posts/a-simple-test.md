# Dummy data, just testing the sort method. ✌🏿

And now I'm checking **to see if markdown parsing** is _working_ correctly.

[This is a test link](https://www.duckduckgo.com)

`const values = ["🕺🏿", false, {}, () => {}, 15]; for (let i of values) { console.log(typeof i); }`

Testing the close to see if this "fixes" the layout issue.
