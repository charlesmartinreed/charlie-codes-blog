## Not coding is worse than coding.

Say that daily, like a mantra. On days like today, ones when I'm so intimidated by the amount of work left to be done in a a project, my impulse is to avoid the computer altogether. And why not? Working on something _other_ than the grand idea would be a waste of time!

Unless you've somehow mastered the art of your chosen language -- god bless -- there is no such thing as wasted time when it comes to honing your skills.

So today, instead of doing nothing in particular, I built a cute little animated website. [Wanna see it? Check it out on Github](https://charlesmartinreed.github.io/glowing-little-boxes).

There isn't much going on, about 140 lines of _fairly_ unoptimized JavaScript, most of which are helper functions dedicated to encapsulating some of the more repetitive things, but it was still a great workout. And a reminder that even trivial things can take a non-trivial amount of time to build. I even challenged myself to write equivalent utility classes for common things like converting **hex to rgb** so that I could leverage the result within a simple **darken** method for styling box shadows programmatically.

I consider exercises like this to be the coder equivalent of Sudoku or Wordle in that they're straightforward, honest tests of your temerity.

Tomorrow I'll probably have to get back to that Big, Scary Project. But for now, I'm going to put up some music, hit F11 and watch some glowing boxes fill up the screen.
